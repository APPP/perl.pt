            <p><br /><i>The Perl Foundation is looking at giving some grants ranging from $500 to $3000 in February 2008.</i></p>

<p><i>In the past, we've supported Adam Kennedy's <span class="caps">PPI,</span>
Nicholas Clark's work on Perl internals, Jouke Visser's pVoice, Chris
Dolan on Perl::Critic and many others (just check
http://www.perlfoundation.org/grants for more references).</i></p>

<p><i>You don't have to have a large, complex, or lengthy project. You
don't even have to be a Perl master or guru. If you have a good idea
and the means and ability to accomplish it, we want to hear from you!</i></p>

<p><i>Do you have something that could benefit the Perl community but just
need that little extra help? Submit a grant proposal by January 31.</i></p>



<p><i>As a general rule, a properly formatted grant proposal is more likely to be approved if it meets the following criteria<br /></i></p><ul><li><i>It has widespread benefit to the Perl community or a large segment of it.</i></li><li><i>We have reason to believe that you can accomplish your goals.</i></li><li><i>We can afford it.</i></li></ul>

<p><i>To submit a proposal, see the guidelines at <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/how_to_write_a_proposal">http://www.perlfoundation.org/how_to_write_a_proposal</a>, and <span class="caps">TPF </span>rules of operation at <a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/rules_of_operation">http://www.perlfoundation.org/rules_of_operation</a>. Then send your proposal to <a href="mailto:tpf-proposals@perl-foundation.org">tpf-proposals@perl-foundation.org</a> before January 31.</i></p>
